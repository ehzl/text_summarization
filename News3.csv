Gaza aid ship to dock in Egypt after Israel pressure,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip,1,"A ship with supplies for Gaza will dock at el-Arish in Egypt, officials say, after Israeli pressure to stop the vessel breaking its Gaza blockade. The Moldovan-flagged ship chartered by a charity run by the son of Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi, left a Greek port on Saturday. Israel asked for help from the UN, and had talks with Greece and Moldova. But organisers insist they will go to Gaza. An Israeli raid on a Gaza-bound ship in May killed nine Turkish activists. Israel insisted its troops were defending themselves but the raid sparked international condemnation. Israel recently eased its blockade, allowing in almost all consumer goods but maintaining a ""blacklist"" of some items. Israel says its blockade of the Palestinian territory is needed to prevent the supply of weapons to the Hamas militant group which controls Gaza. The Amalthea, renamed Hope for the mission, set off from the Greek port of Lavrio, loaded with about 2,000 tonnes of food, cooking oil, medicines and pre-fabricated houses. It has been chartered by the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation. Its chairman is Saif al-Islam Gaddafi. The organisation said the 92m (302ft) vessel would also carry ""a number of supporters who are keen on expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people"".",,None,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid

Talent Agency WME drops Mel Gibson,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Gibson,3,"Cast member Mel Gibson (R) and Oksana Grigorieva attend the premiere of the film ''Edge of Darkness'' in Los Angeles January 26, 2010. Earlier this week, the agency's Patrick Whitesell informed the actors' representatives that he would no longer be represented by the agency. Gibson's longtime agent, Ed Limato, died July 3, and a funeral will take place in New York next week. William Morris Endeavor (WME) partner Ari Emanuel had previously expressed hostility toward Gibson after the actor made anti-Semitic remarks and made remarks implying skepticism about the Holocaust. An agency source said the only reason the agency had represented Gibson in the first place was his association with Limato. ""Mel was really important to Ed,"" an agency source said. ""He was with him for 32 years and I think Ed saw him as a son."" But he added, ""The world knows how Ari feels and he has never changed that opinion."" Gibson's troubles have only increased in recent weeks with allegations of bigoted tirades and reports that he is under investigation for assaulting his ex-girlfriend. Several studio executives have said in the wake of these disclosures that they consider the troubled actor too untouchable in the industry. ""I'd rather get engaged to Lindsay Lohan than have anything to do with him,"" one studio chief said. A spokesman for Gibson could not be reached for comment.",,None,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_Weapon_(film_series)
